#Four primitive types of variables:
#integer - a whole number. for example: 8
#string - a bunch of characters like a sentence. for example: "hello world" 
#float - any number including decimals. for example: 23.5
# boolean - true or false


# remember what i is for; i is often used because it means increment
#for i in range(4):
#    print(i)

# this is a list of sports
#sports = ["baseball", "football", "hockey", "soccer", "cricket"]
#print(sports)

#remember the first position is always 0; so spot 2 is hockey
#print(sports[2])

#for i in range(len(sports)):
#    print(sports)
#print(len(sports))

#this prints out each item in the list
#for i in range(len(sports)):
#    print(sports[i])


#if 1==2:
#    print("That was true")
#else:
#    print("This is false")
